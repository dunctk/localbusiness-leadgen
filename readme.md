# Maps Local Leadgen

The goal of this project is to identify local businesses that have poorly set up local profiles such as Google My Business, and personlise messages to reach out to them to offer help.

## Why would a business want this?

People increasingly rely on internet searches to find local businesses they can trust, and social profiles typically show up ahead of the company's own website in search. However many small businesses are not aware they could make some simple improvements to these profiles and generate significantly more inbound calls, leads, and sales.
